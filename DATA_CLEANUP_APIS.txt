RADIUS API - Data Cleanup APIs Implementation
============================================

🚀 Deployment Status: ✅ SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED
Deployment Time: 2025-09-01 09:39:49

🔑 API Key: your-secret-bearer-token-here

🗑️ NEW DATA CLEANUP ENDPOINTS:
===============================

## 1. Cleanup Accounting Data:
POST /cleanup/radacct

### Purpose:
- Deletes old accounting records from radacct table
- Filters by acctstarttime field
- Keeps only the last N days of data

### Request Format:
```json
{
  "retain_days": 90,
  "confirm": false
}
```

### Safety Features:
✅ Minimum retention: 30 days
✅ Preview mode (confirm=false) shows what would be deleted
✅ Execution mode (confirm=true) performs actual deletion

---

## 2. Cleanup Authentication Logs:
POST /cleanup/radpostauth

### Purpose:
- Deletes old authentication logs from radpostauth table
- Filters by authdate field
- Keeps only the last N days of data

### Request Format:
```json
{
  "retain_days": 30,
  "confirm": false
}
```

### Safety Features:
✅ Minimum retention: 7 days
✅ Preview mode (confirm=false) shows what would be deleted
✅ Execution mode (confirm=true) performs actual deletion

🔍 SQL QUERIES USED:
====================

### Preview Queries (COUNT only):
```sql
-- Accounting preview
SELECT COUNT(*) as records_to_delete,
       MIN(acctstarttime) as oldest_record
FROM radacct 
WHERE acctstarttime < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL ? DAY);

-- Auth logs preview
SELECT COUNT(*) as records_to_delete,
       MIN(authdate) as oldest_record
FROM radpostauth 
WHERE authdate < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL ? DAY);
```

### Deletion Queries:
```sql
-- Delete old accounting records
DELETE FROM radacct 
WHERE acctstarttime < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL ? DAY);

-- Delete old auth logs
DELETE FROM radpostauth 
WHERE authdate < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL ? DAY);
```

📝 USAGE EXAMPLES:
==================

### 1. Preview Accounting Cleanup (SAFE):
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cleanup/radacct" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-bearer-token-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "retain_days": 90,
    "confirm": false
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "PREVIEW: Would delete 17631 accounting records older than 90 days. Oldest record: 2020-03-22 18:09:10. Set confirm=true to execute deletion."
}
```

### 2. Execute Accounting Cleanup:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cleanup/radacct" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-bearer-token-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "retain_days": 90,
    "confirm": true
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Successfully deleted 17631 accounting records older than 90 days"
}
```

### 3. Preview Auth Log Cleanup (SAFE):
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cleanup/radpostauth" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-bearer-token-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "retain_days": 30,
    "confirm": false
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "PREVIEW: Would delete 7934 authentication log records older than 30 days. Oldest record: 2020-06-18 17:46:43. Set confirm=true to execute deletion."
}
```

### 4. Execute Auth Log Cleanup:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cleanup/radpostauth" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-bearer-token-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "retain_days": 30,
    "confirm": true
  }'
```

⚠️ ERROR RESPONSES:
===================

### Minimum Retention Violation:
```json
{
  "detail": "Minimum retention: 30 days for accounting data"
}
```

```json
{
  "detail": "Minimum retention: 7 days for auth logs"
}
```

### Invalid Field Values:
```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "greater_than_equal",
      "loc": ["body", "retain_days"],
      "msg": "Input should be greater than or equal to 1"
    }
  ]
}
```

🛡️ SAFETY FEATURES:
====================

✅ **Preview First**: Default confirm=false prevents accidental deletions
✅ **Minimum Retention**: Enforced minimums protect recent data
✅ **Clear Feedback**: Shows exactly what will be deleted with dates
✅ **Validation**: Input validation prevents invalid requests
✅ **Efficient Queries**: Uses DATE_SUB() for optimal performance
✅ **Authentication**: Requires Bearer token for all operations

🔄 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
========================

1. **Preview First**: Always run with confirm=false to see impact
2. **Review Results**: Check count and oldest record date
3. **Verify Timing**: Ensure you're comfortable with the retention period
4. **Execute**: Run again with confirm=true to perform deletion
5. **Monitor**: Check response for successful deletion count

🎯 USE CASES:
=============

### Regular Maintenance:
- Monthly cleanup: Keep 90 days of accounting, 30 days of auth logs
- Weekly cleanup: Keep 60 days of accounting, 14 days of auth logs

### Compliance Requirements:
- Legal retention: Keep 365 days of accounting data
- Security audits: Keep 180 days of authentication logs

### Storage Management:
- Disk space cleanup: Aggressive retention (30 days accounting, 7 days auth)
- Performance optimization: Remove old data to improve query speed

📊 TESTED FUNCTIONALITY:
=========================

✅ Preview mode works correctly (shows counts and dates)
✅ Execution mode performs actual deletions
✅ Safety validations prevent invalid retention periods
✅ Response format is consistent and informative
✅ Authentication works with Bearer token
✅ Database queries are efficient and safe

📚 ACCESS POINTS:
